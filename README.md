### How I made this app

My first step in this project was to sketch the basic layout of the app. Then, I coded most of the functionality using HTML and JavaScript. Once I had things working the way I wanted, I scaffolded out the app using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and refactored the code I had written in HTML and JS.
